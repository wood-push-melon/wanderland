The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2. Note: Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice. Example: 12345Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9Output: [1,2]Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2. SolutionsThe key point is to take advantage of sorted array. We can use two pointers strategy or binary search method to solve this problem. Two solutions are shown below respectively. Solution with two pointers is relatively easy to catch, and it should be the first answer you provide in an interview. Two pointer solution: 123456789101112# Solution with two pointersdef twoSum(nums: 'List[int]', target: 'int') -&gt; 'List[int]': lo, hi = 0, len(nums) - 1 while lo &lt; hi: s = nums[lo] + nums[hi] if s == target: return [lo+1, hi+1] elif s &lt; target: lo += 1 else: hi -= 1 Binary search solution: Binary search solution is kind of difficult to understant compared with two pointer one. Basically it uses binary search algorithm to move start or end pointer faster rather than one step in each iteration. It tries to move start to a new position where nums[start] is the first value that nums[start] &gt;= target - nums[end] if the sum is less than target. Similar logic applies to end pointer. In each helper function, we only consider the pointer we care about. 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445# Solution using binary searchdef twoSum(nums: 'List[int]', target: 'int') -&gt; 'List[int]': start, end = 0, len(nums) - 1 while start &lt; end: s = nums[start] + nums[end] if s == target: return [start+1, end+1] elif s &lt; target: # need to adjust start pointer start = binary_search_start(nums, start, end, target-nums[end]) else: # need to adjust end pointer end = binary_search_end(nums, start, end, target-nums[start])def binary_search_start(nums, start, end, key): ''' Move the start pointer to the position where nums[start] is the first element greater than or equal to the key ''' while start &lt;= end: mid = start + (end - start) // 2 if nums[mid] &lt; key: start = mid + 1 else: end = mid - 1 return startdef binary_search_end(nums, start, end, key): ''' Move the end pointer to the position where nums[end] is the last element less than or equal to the key ''' while start &lt;= end: mid = start + (end - start) // 2 if nums[mid] &gt; key: end = mid - 1 else: start = mid + 1 return end","link":"/wanderland/2019/02/10/2sum-sorted/"},{"title":"2Sum","text":"ProblemGiven an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to specific target.You may assume that each inpjut would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

NOTE: Initially the closest sum should be given a starting value for comparison inside the loop later. Here we start it with the sum of first three elements, which is the minimum sum among all three-element combinations after soring the input array. However, what the closest initially is does not matter. 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738394041def three_sum_closest(nums, target): n = len(nums) if n &lt; 3: return nums.sort() # initialize closest sum closest = nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] for i in range(n-2): l , r = i + 1, n - 1 while l &lt; r: s = nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] if s == target: return s if abs(s-target) &lt; abs(closest-target): closest = s if s &lt; target: l = increment(nums, l, r) else: r = decrement(nums, l, r) return closestdef increment(nums, l, r): while l &lt; r and nums[l] == nums[l+1]: l += 1 return l + 1def decrement(nums, l, r): while l &lt; r and nums[r] == nums[r-1]: r -= 1 return r - 1","link":"/wanderland/2019/02/18/3sum-closest/"},{"title":"3 Sum","text":"ProblemGiven an array nums of n integers, are there three elements a, b, c in nums such that a + b + c = 0 ?

NOTE The problem specifies that no duplicate driplets should appear in the result, so we have to take this in mind. To meet this requirement, moving left and right pointers should be more aggressive, like skipping next element with same value. 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738394041424344454647def three_sum(nums: 'List[int]') -&gt; 'List[List[int]]': res = [] n = len(nums) if n &lt; 3: return res nums.sort() # sort the input first for i in range(n-2): # no need to move on if the fixed element is greater than 0 if nums[i] &gt; 0: break # skip elements with same value if i &gt; 0 and nums[i] == nums[i-1]: continue l, r = i + 1, n - 1 while l &lt; r: s = nums[i] + nums[l] + nums[r] if s == 0: res.append([nums[i], nums[l], nums[r]]) l = increment(nums, l, r) r = decrement(nums, l, r) elif s &lt; 0: l = increment(nums, l, r) else: r = decrement(nums, l, r) return res# increment pointer by skipping same-value elementsdef increment(nums, l, r): while l &lt; r and nums[l] == nums[l+1]: l += 1 return l + 1# decrement pointer by skipping same-value elementsdef decrement(nums, l, r): while l &lt; r and nums[r] == nums[r-1]: r -= 1 return r - 1","link":"/wanderland/2019/02/16/3sum/"},{"title":"Hello World","text":"Welcome to Hexo!
